A joke plugin that I made on a Saturday morning because I was bored. It adds a socio-status-relevant Dr. Breen reaction to the upper-right corner of the screen that changes face poses and ambient light based on the current Socio-Status.

This requires the [Combine Technology Overlay plugin](https://plugins.gethelix.co/combine-technology-overlay/) in order to function, otherwise Breen will be neutral.

Note: This requires [Counter-Strike: Source](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/) to be mounted for the plant model in the background.
