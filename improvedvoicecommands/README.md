- Config options

## Config Options
- Experimental Mode VC
    - Adapts casing of voice commands according to the rest of the sentence
    - Uses punctuation mark and casing for logic
- Radio VCAllow
    - Determines if voice commands can be used on the radio.
- Radio VCClient Only
    - Voice command playback on receivers will only be played for every receiver clientside, as such people around them won't hear the sounds.
- Radio VCVolume
    - Determines the volume of the radio playback for receivers
- Separator VC
    - The separator between voice commands. Can be anything, but it's best to choose a symbol, that isn't used often. Leave it empty if you want commands to be separated by spaces. This might not always work as expected for example with the voice command "10-8 Standing By" as "10-8" on its own is a voice command.
