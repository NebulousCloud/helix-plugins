Simple plugin that provides users and staff with tools to modify their bodygroups from a fresh-looking menu.

## Features
- Users can modify their bodygroups from a menu.
- Staff can modify other's bodygroups as well.
- Staffs can forbid other players to use the menu with a command so those who don't use it in a correct way just can't use it anymore (same command to reverse the prohibition)
- Colors can be modified in config.
- Factions can be added to a ByPass table so that its members can use the menu even if the use of the menu is disabled!
- Spanish and English translations for *almost* everything

## Installation
- After downloading the files, just add the folder "simple_bodygroup_manager" to your schema/plugins folder
