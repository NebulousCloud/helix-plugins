Combine Assistant, or CA for short, originally created by Blt950 for the Clockwork framework, has been recreated for Helix. While not an entirely accurate copy of the original plugin, it adds several useful features for Combine factions. I plan to improve it at some point and add some more things.

This plugin has built-in support for the CTO (Combine Technology Overlay) plugin, and adds a few more features if the plugin is installed.
