The Assistance Terminals are essentially glorified request devices. Their function is the same - to allow citizens and other human factions to request a Combine officer to their location.

The plugin comes with native support for the [Waypoints plugin](https://plugins.gethelix.co/waypoints/) by [Gr4Ss](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997384060). When a request is made, a waypoint will appear at the location of the terminal.

Finally, the plugin makes use of the Areas plugin that comes with Helix by default - meaning you will need to set up some areas around the map, if you wish to make use of the location feature of the terminals, otherwise the terminal location will default to "Unknown Location".
